<h1>THE BEST MUSIC TO EVER EXISTED!!!</h1>
<h2>My top 3 music of all time, according to Victor.</h2>
<hr /> 
<h3>1. Arcade by Duncan Lawrence </h3>
<p>This song is about soul that yearns and is addicted to a relationship that is falling apart.</p>
<h3>2. Maniac by Conan Gray</h3>
<p>Addictive song with upbeat melody but relatable lyrics with a mixture of angry/sad vibes sprinkled into it.</p>
<h3>3. Memory Reboot from the movie Blade Runner</h3>
<p>Self-explanatory, a song to chill and vibe to during rainy days or when you feel melancholic.</p>
<h3>Let me write you an unrelated poem to spice things up!</h3>
<p>
   Tell all of your friends that; <br />
   I am crazy and drive you mad; <br />
   That I'am such a stalker, a watcher, a psychopath; <br />
   Then tell them you hate me, and dated me just for laughs; <br />
   So why do you call me, and tell me, you want me back?; <br />
   You maniac! <br />
